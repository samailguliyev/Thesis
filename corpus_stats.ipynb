Even if you're bulking up, you should eat more HEALTHY food, and going to the gym will help both of you. You can both bitch about how sore you are, and while she complains about how hard it is to run 3 miles, you can say how weak you feel compared to the other guys lifting at the gym.\\n\\nOverweight women sometimes make the mistake of thinking that all skinny people have it really easy...commiserating about how you're not 100 percent in love with your body and want to improve it, too, could help her out a lot.   \n",
       "2227966  Story 1 --- not so terrible. a buddy of mine invited me and a friend over for drinks.  We get there and they just started a game of kings cup.  I grab a drink and ask if we can join in.  there's 3 chicks at this table that I didn't know, so we go through the introductions.  I wasn't sure, but thought the girl said her name was Yvonne. So I ask her to repeat it. \"Oh Yvonne?\" \"No, its Avonne.  Even a third grader would have gotten it by now\"  I wasn't hurt, just dumbfounded.  I've never been called stupid in such record time.\\n\\nlater, I draw a jack (make a rule card) and make the rule that with every drink, you have to insult someone at the table.  I stare at her as I say it and she doesn't like the idea.  Says its mean.  I reply with \"but you'd be really good at it.\"\\n\\n---Story 2---\\nLived in france, had french girlfriend.  went back to france for gf. paid for school, found job. talking about marriage.  want gf to visit my home and meet my family first.  I fly back, find an apartment, help find her a job, give her money for plane ticket.  3 days before she is supposed to get on plane, she writes a I don't love you anymore email.  relationship over.  \\n\\ngirls are weird.   \n",

Super friendly, huge smiles, huge eyes, that glistening skin look and unconsciously groping each others hands - obviously super high. I noticed them several times.\\n\\nLater I was out front of the bar, where everyone went to smoke. The rolling couple came out and were waiting to cross the street - super giddy and so high they weren't making a ton of sense. Cars were going by fairly fast - like 30-35. Anyway there's a small stretch of no-cars, so they start to cross, then the boyfriend realizes they don't really have time and backs away. The girlfriend keeps running, confusedly tearing away from his hand-holding after a moment's hesitation, and this car that was fucking *blazing* by (maybe drunk?) slams right into her. She *flew* back some six feet and landed in the middle of the smoking patio on her back. The car screeched to a halt (30 yards or more down the road), then its reverse lights came on, then they went back off and it hauled ass down the road.\\n\\nThere was blood coming out of the girls mouth, she wasn't answering my questions, and she was hyperventilating. The boyfriend was an insta-wreck. Scream-crying and the like. The girl did not say word one. She had a tense, weird smile and made sharp little breathing noises with huge, staring, blinking eyes. The paramedics arrived and took her away within minutes, I'm not sure what happened to her.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded that the guy drove away.

(Even if we are all gay, medicine still lets us reproduce)\\n\\nThat said, if it was a genetic trait rather than a state of mind then it would most likely have died out due to the inability for homosexual couples to reproduce in the past.\\n\\nIt is most likely to be caused by the development of the brain due to environment, diet and personal taste, much like a personality develops as we age.\\n\\nHumans are strange in this respect anyway.

Spending charity inefficiently is the same as having less charity to begin with.\\n\\nI have a reasonable amount of money and I spend a lot of time and energy thinking about how to best spend my charity to provide maximum benefit to those who need it. Tossing dollars at problems blindly is an act of selfish egoism; it is not truly altruistic.\\n\\nHave a nice day.   \n",

My kind usually don't go near land, because bad mean humans live there. But I thought \"What could happen?\" so I went near. As I got closer I saw two men pointing a long object with a thin barrel at its end. I heard a bang, and tiny projectiles were hitting the water very very fast. I had no idea what was going on. I tried to swim away really fast. While swimming away, I felt one of them pierce through my fin and another fractured my tusk.\\n\\nI am lucky to be alive. But now I have no friends, because I am the only one of my kind without a tusk :( DAMN YOU MEN!   \n",

It made me scared to go to the bathroom because I thought I was just peeing in the corner of a room while some scientists watched me. \\n\\nI also thought that adults had all of their adult conversations over the roof of a car and once I was tall enough to see over the roof of our car I would be an adult. Turns out my parents just liked to fight over the roof before we got in the car.    \n",

       "2227919  Woah that's fucked. Something similar happened to me in SLC. I was in a bar with my then girlfriend. The bar was pretty crowded but there was a guy and his girlfriend who were obviously on ecstasy. Super friendly, huge smiles, huge eyes, that glistening skin look and unconsciously groping each others hands - obviously super high. I noticed them several times.\\n\\nLater I was out front of the bar, where everyone went to smoke. The rolling couple came out and were waiting to cross the street - super giddy and so high they weren't making a ton of sense. Cars were going by fairly fast - like 30-35. Anyway there's a small stretch of no-cars, so they start to cross, then the boyfriend realizes they don't really have time and backs away. The girlfriend keeps running, confusedly tearing away from his hand-holding after a moment's hesitation, and this car that was fucking *blazing* by (maybe drunk?) slams right into her. She *flew* back some six feet and landed in the middle of the smoking patio on her back. The car screeched to a halt (30 yards or more down the road), then its reverse lights came on, then they went back off and it hauled ass down the road.\\n\\nThere was blood coming out of the girls mouth, she wasn't answering my questions, and she was hyperventilating. The boyfriend was an insta-wreck. Scream-crying and the like. The girl did not say word one. She had a tense, weird smile and made sharp little breathing noises with huge, staring, blinking eyes. The paramedics arrived and took her away within minutes, I'm not sure what happened to her.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded that the guy drove away. But in hindsight, I can understand the cowardice when faced with a drunk, angry mob. \\n\\nEDIT: apostrophe!   \n",

She was a friend once, and when we started talking it took me a long time to trust as one again. Don't be mad at me, women (just as men) do shitty things because of their own character flaws. Not because someone else makes them feel its ok. If I stayed her boyfriend and continued the relationship then I would understand your anger. Part of my complacent personality at the time (when I was 20) I am sure attributed to this happening, but it happened to me, not to some other guy. Our continued friendship is a constant reminder to her of what happened and shames her to apologizing out of the blue. I know she feels regret, but is thankful that I am still able to be her friend.   \n",

The rent is reasonable, the neighborhood isn't scary, it's close to bart to get to SF, and theres actually a night life.   \n",

(Even if we are all gay, medicine still lets us reproduce)\\n\\nThat said, if it was a genetic trait rather than a state of mind then it would most likely have died out due to the inability for homosexual couples to reproduce in the past.\\n\\nIt is most likely to be caused by the development of the brain due to environment, diet and personal taste, much like a personality develops as we age.\\n\\nHumans are strange in this respect anyway.  What is the evolutionary purpose of anything?  If we evolved from monkeys then why not stop there?  monkeys function perfectly in their ability to reproduce, which is all that a species is required to do anyway.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nIts an anomaly, who cares?   \n",

The problem we have nowadays is that the goals are less certain and people aren't sure the cost is worth it because they aren't assured of benefits.\\n\\nEven if we don't admit it to ourselves much of what we pursue is to increase our status, power and choice. Many people don't seek to be friends with the homeless because of this - such drives also allow the cosmetic &amp; clothes industry to fleece us. I do think humanity can rise above its individual narcissism but only after individuals go through a coming of age process.\\n\\nThere is no reason to believe life is about happiness. Relentlessly seeking to please yourself may have dire consequences for all of humanity. Shouldn't individuals feel a duty to try and help society? I am not saying pursuing mortgages or families does that - but shouldn't people decide to try and ease suffering of each other?    \n",

I make fun of my situation all the time. The funnier the jests, the better.  I never said I haven't got laid. That isn't hard in college. I've just never been in a serious relationship where I've felt like I could completely be myself and the same for her. I don't know if it's just me, but drunken hookups just don't interest me after trying it out a couple of times, so while I don't mind meeting new girls while I'm out at a bar, I hate the idea of being misleading or overly-macho to impress some girl that I just want to bang and forget about.\\n\\nAlso, I don't know if it's just me, but I grew up in another country and it seems like people handle relationships differently in the USA vs other parts. Where I used to live, it was normal for two friends of the opposite sex to be friends for a long time and gradually develop into a relationship. I'm sure I could be wrong, but it seems like here people in the States like to go from just meeting to dating, and I suck at making that jump.\\n\\nI always have an excuse to avoid a relationship too. Right now it's the fact that I'm graduating and leaving the state in about 5 months. Before, it was my commitment to getting into law school. Before that...and so on and so on.   \n",

A bulk of students are that way inclined, and there's only usually a few in a class who are interested.

Even if you're bulking up, you should eat more HEALTHY food, and going to the gym will help both of you. You can both bitch about how sore you are, and while she complains about how hard it is to run 3 miles, you can say how weak you feel compared to the other guys lifting at the gym.\\n\\nOverweight women sometimes make the mistake of thinking that all skinny people have it really easy...commiserating about how you're not 100 percent in love with your body and want to improve it, too, could help her out a lot.   \n",

We get there and they just started a game of kings cup.  I grab a drink and ask if we can join in.  there's 3 chicks at this table that I didn't know, so we go through the introductions.  I wasn't sure, but thought the girl said her name was Yvonne. So I ask her to repeat it. \"Oh Yvonne?\" \"No, its Avonne.  Even a third grader would have gotten it by now\"  I wasn't hurt, just dumbfounded.  I've never been called stupid in such record time.\\n\\nlater, I draw a jack (make a rule card) and make the rule that with every drink, you have to insult someone at the table.  I stare at her as I say it and she doesn't like the idea.  Says its mean.  I reply with \"but you'd be really good at it.\"\\n\\n---Story 2---\\nLived in france, had french girlfriend.  went back to france for gf. paid for school, found job. talking about marriage.  want gf to visit my home and meet my family first.  I fly back, find an apartment, help find her a job, give her money for plane ticket.  3 days before she is supposed to get on plane, she writes a I don't love you anymore email.  relationship over.  \\n\\ngirls are weird.   \n",
